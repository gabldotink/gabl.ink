This directory is for named pipes, also known as FIFOs (first in, first out). The filename for each named pipe should start with a dot. This readme file is the only file that should be here permanently. The script should delete them after it’s done with them. You can safely delete them yourself if you are sure that the script is not running.

If a named pipe cannot be created, a regular file will be created to perform the same function.
