Welcome to <i class="nw"><cite>JoeRunner and Co.</cite></i>!    </p><p>My name’s Gabriel, <abbr title="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr><span translate="no">gabl</span>, and I can’t wait to share my passion-project comics with you. I’ve been drawing these characters for several years, and I’ve wanted to do a webcomic for… less years, but still multiple. Years.</p><p>They’re… still a bit rough around the edges. I’ve been drawing cartoons for half of my life, but I haven’t been good about challenging myself. Hopefully, this comic will help improve my cartooning skills. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make people laugh. Maybe I’ll even be able to get a girlfriend. I dunno. It’s possible.</p><p>… I look forward to taking this journey with you!</p><p><span class="nw">—            <span translate="no">gabl</span></span></p></html></content></post><copyright><year><first>2022</first><last>2025</last></year><license>cc-by-4.0</license></copyright><disclaimer>olympic</disclaimer><content_rating><label>general</label><notice><text>Features an alarm clock, which may alarm some readers.</text><html>Features an alarm clock, which may alarm some readers.</html></notice></content_rating></gabl.ink_item>
