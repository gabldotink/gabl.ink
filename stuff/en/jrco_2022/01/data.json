Welcome to <i class=\"nw\"><cite>JoeRunner and Co.</cite></i>!</p><p>My name’s Gabriel, <abbr title=\"also known as\">a.k.a.</abbr> <span translate=\"no\">gabl</span>, and I can’t wait to share my passion-project comics with you. I’ve been drawing these characters for several years, and I’ve wanted to do a webcomic for… less years, but still multiple. Years.</p><p>They’re… still a bit rough around the edges. I’ve been drawing cartoons for half of my life, but I haven’t been good about challenging myself. Hopefully, this comic will help improve my cartooning skills. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make people laugh. Maybe I’ll even be able to get a girlfriend. I dunno. It’s possible.</p><p>… I look forward to taking this journey with you!</p><p><span class=\"nw\">— <span translate=\"no\">gabl</span></span></p>"
