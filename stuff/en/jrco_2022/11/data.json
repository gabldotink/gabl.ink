JoeRunner looks at him amusedly.</p><p>[T.T.] But, like… how come no one <em class=\"i\">told</em> me?</p><p>JoeRunner and T.T. go to their seats next to each other. T.T. points backward.</p><p>[T.T.] Oh, hey, I think the new kid is back there.</p><p>[JoeRunner] (<i>smiling</i>) Oh, really?</p><p>The new kid is writing a letter at her desk, just finishing her signature. She has medium-length red (orange) hair. She wears a dark turquoise shirt.</p><p>[letter] Dear Mr. Mahan, Thank you very much for having me for the last two weeks of school. I look forward to it. That is all I have to say. <span class=\"nw\">— Ma</span></p><p>[T.T.] (<i>off-panel</i>) Oh, darn, I forgot to get her name from Harry.</p><p>JoeRunner starts getting out of his seat.</p><p>[JoeRunner] Well then, let’s go ask her!</p><p>[T.T.] Great plan, except…</p><p>A clock shows it’s <time datetime=\"2021-05-27T08:30-0600\">8:30</time>.</p><p>[sound effects] <i>Brrrrrring!</i></p><p>JoeRunner and T.T. look back, a little disappointed.</p><p>[JoeRunner] Oh, well, I guess she’ll introduce herself first.</p>"

People… people probably say that.</p><details><summary><p>Irrelevant info</p></summary><p>This page includes the full-size image, while previously they’ve been half-size. The HTML <picture> element should either automatically choose one to display, or simply skip it and use the full image, depending on your browser / user agent.</p><p>I was initially meaning to upload the full-size versions to Patreon, but I’ll probably just save that for the <code><abbr title=\"Clip Studio Paint\">.clip</abbr></code> work files. I don’t know when I’ll get the images out, but I will.</p></details><p>Of course, you can safely expect Patreon to be a pretty long ways away at this rate. If I can be real for a sec, one of the main reasons I started this comic was to feel like I was doing something with my life, and now it’s ended up as a huge source of anxiety for me because progress is so slow. I’m so excited to continue this, especially since I have a lot of other ideas to work on aside from <i><cite>JoeRunner and co.</cite></i>—both apart from and on top of it. I’m so sorry that I’m not getting that out sooner.</p><p>Um… on an unrelated note, color! I haven’t been using color so far because I had the notion that it would take too long, but I wanted that panel to be better-drawn anyway, so I went ahead and did it. And now I’m thinking maybe I should do that more often.</p><details><summary><p>Irrelevant info</p></summary><p>On a dumb, overthinking-related note (feel free to skip this), I’m trying to decide if I want to stick with <abbr title=\"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</abbr>, or if I want to move it to <abbr title=\"Creative Commons Attribution\">CC BY</abbr>. At the start it was <abbr title=\"Attribtuon-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\">BY-NC-SA</abbr>. Both times the <abbr title=\"ShareAlike\">SA</abbr> was because I wanted to keep derivatives of actual, general utility free, like books and translations. I know that <i><a href=\"https://peppercarrot.com\" rel=\"external\" type=\"text/html\"><cite>Pepper&Carrot</cite></a></i> is thriving in those regards under <abbr>CC BY</abbr>, but that may or may not be different, considering that <i><cite>Pepper&Carrot</cite></i> isn’t one of the most egregious abominations known to man.</p><p>And about those multiple image size problems, I want to make a <cite>Git</cite> repository to hold all of those (and the other stuff, of course) in order to have a sort of structured, static <abbr title=\"application programming interface\">API</abbr>, while also just having the files available in a human-browsable and easily downloadable manner. I already tried that with files.gabl.ink <small>(link removed)</small>, but I ended up not liking how it turned out.</p>"
