# gabl.ink

This is the source repository for the new [gabl.ink](https://gabl.ink/)
website.

This repository is public, but it’s not live on the website yet, so I
can (and likely will) change pretty much anything for now&mdash;that
is, this repository is currently not _stable_ at all.

The GitHub version of this repository ([`gabldotink/gabl.ink`](
https://github.com/gabldotink/gabl.ink)) will possibly be archived
and/or repurposed when it’s pushed to the Web in the relatively-near
future. The repo will be made available for browsing and cloning at
[gabl.ink](https://gabl.ink/). The commits from GitHub will be kept, of
course.

That all might not happen, either; it’s just a warning about stability.
I’ll update it when I’ve figured out the infrastructure further.
