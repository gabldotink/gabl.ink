# Git

Git is a version control system (VCS). A VCS is a computer application
that allows tracking the history of a set of files (often source code)
so that previous versions of those files are accessible, and old files
can be easily updated.

gabl.ink is version controlled by Git. For you, the user of the site
and content, this means that you can keep an up-to-date copy of the
website without too much headache. Any headache that _would_ pop up
will hopefully be alleviated by this guide.

## installing Git

To use Git, you’ll have to install it. If you’re using Linux, you
probably already have it installed.

## downloading gabl.ink with Git

You only need to know some very rudimentary commands to keep a copy of
gabl.ink with Git once you have it installed. You can use either of the
following URLs (if one does):

  * <https://gabl.ink/git/>
  * <https://github.com/gabldotink/gabl.ink>

Here are the commands you can use:

  * Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://gabl.ink/git/ gabl.ink
    cd gabl.ink
    ```
  * Update the repository:
    ```shell
    git pull
    ```
