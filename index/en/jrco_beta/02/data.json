After it clatters, there are sounds of a car crash, a man screaming in pain (Wilhelm scream), and a cat shrieking. An exasperated young male voice speaks."

This one and page 4 are animated mostly to better get the jokes across, and since I am incredibly lazy, if I don’t need to animate them for that purpose I probably won’t.</p>"
