        Hey there! Welcome to <cite class="it nw">JoeRunner and
        Co.</cite>!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name’s Gabriel, <abbr>a.k.a.</abbr> gabl, and I can’t wait
        to share my passion-project comics with you. I’ve been drawing
        these characters for several years, and I’ve wanted to do a
        webcomic for… less years, but still multiple. Years.
      </p>
      <p>
        They’re… still a bit rough around the edges. I’ve been drawing
        cartoons for half of my life, but I haven’t been good about
        challenging myself. Hopefully, this comic will help improve my
        cartooning skills. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make people laugh.
        Maybe I’ll even be able to get a girlfriend. I dunno. It’s
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to taking this journey with you!
      </p>
