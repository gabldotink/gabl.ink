Also, this is probably funnier anyway. I’ll have to post the original draft at some point, I guess. The drawing in this page is probably some of my worst. I hate my art so much, but I’m posting it on the internet forever anyway.</p><p>Remember when I said I was going to get a page a week done? Yeah. I’m a riot.</p>"
