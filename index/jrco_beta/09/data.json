There’s so much that I want to get to, and it’s a bit upsetting to me that I’ve only gotten this far, with <i><cite>JoeRunner and Co.</cite></i>’s first anniversary being in two days (<time datetime=\"2023-04-01\">April\u00a01</time>). This page especially took a lot of effort\u2060—the most yet\u2060—due to its length.</p><p>Only about 60% of the draft I wrote back on\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. <i>checks</i> <em class=\"i nw\"><time datetime=\"2021-05-25\">May\u00a025, 2021</time></em>? I really <em class=\"i\">am</em> behind. <i>ahem</i> Only about 60% of the original draft is in this final version. None of these pages so far are super faithful to that draft\u2060—I wrote them when I was around 14\u00a0years old, and of course my dialogue has changed a lot in two years of my teenage life. It means the same thing, but it’s expanded and, dare I say, funnier. Assuming it’s funny at all.</p><p>I have 30\u00a0more pages drafted out, and while undoubtedly not all of it will stay, I’m excited to get through them. I’ve decided that I can get a comic done every week, posted on Thursday, while still doing school. So I’ll try it, and we’ll see how it goes.</p><p>Once again, I so sincerely appreciate everyone who reads my silly, medium–low quality webcomic. I hope that you’ve enjoyed them regardless.</p><p><b>—\u2060\u200a\u2060Gabriel\u00a0/ <span translate=\"no\" data-ssml-phoneme-alphabet=\"ipa\" data-ssml-phoneme-ph=\"ˈɡæbəl\">gabl</span></b></p>"
