As the alarm clock audibly beeps, a hand reaches out from a lump under the covers and smacks the alarm clock on its snooze button on its side, which causes it to slide off the desk. After it clatters, there are sounds of a car crash, a man screaming in pain (Wilhelm scream), and a cat shrieking. An exasperated young male voice speaks."

This one and page 4 are animated mostly to better get the jokes across, and since I am incredibly lazy, if I don’t need to animate them for that purpose I probably won’t.</p>"
