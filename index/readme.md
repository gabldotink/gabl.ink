# stuff

I realized that trying to organize everything at this stage is not
helping with anything at all really. I’m just going to include a bundle
of this repository as a git-annexed file in the final site, and not
bother with making this one good. It’s now just concepts. Hopefully I’ll
work faster on it now, maybe.
